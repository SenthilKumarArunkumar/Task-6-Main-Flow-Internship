TASK-6

Description:
The project involved selecting a dataset of interest and performing a
comprehensive analysis to extract meaningful insights. The project
required applying a full data science workflow, including data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), question formulation, and data
visualization.

RESPONSIBILITY:
1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies to
ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to understand the
distribution of data, relationships between variables.

3. Question Formulation: Developed specific minimum 7 questions related
to heart disease, and solve each question by using appropriate
functions.

4. Data Visualization: Created visualizations using tools like Matplotlib,
Seaborn, to effectively present the findings and insights gained from the
analysis. This included charts, graphs, and other visual aids to make the
results easy to understand.
